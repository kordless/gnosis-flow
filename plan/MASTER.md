Updated the console to a more “loggly-like” layout:

- Timestamp as a tag: [HH:MM:SS] rendered as a small solid tag.
- Entity tags: FILE / DIR / LOG / HIT as compact, solid badges with color.
- Operation tags: ADD / MOD / DEL (for file/dir) as small colored tags (green/yellow/red).
- Message text: shows the path (and for LOG/HIT, a brief message).
- Filter applies to all displayed events; timestamps are included in the row but not used for filtering unless in the JSON.

Also:

- All events include ts from the backend.
- Console preloads the last 200 events from /events at startup so history is visible.
- Event log persists to .gnosis-flow/events.ndjson.
- New HTTP: GET /events?limit=200 returns a JSON array of recent events.

How to see it

- Reinstall and restart:
    - cd gnosis-flow && pip install -e .
    - gnosis-flow stop
    - gnosis-flow start --dir . --http
- Hard refresh /console (Ctrl+F5)
- Run demo (or perform your own file/dir operations):
    - PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\demo.ps1
- You should see rows like:
    - [12:34:56] [FILE] [ADD] C:\path\to\file.txt
    - [12:34:57] [DIR] [DEL] C:\path\to\scratch_demo

If you’d like me to add a quick toggle bar to filter by operation (ADD/MOD/DEL) or entity type (FILE/DIR/LOG/HIT), I can plug that
in next.

we need to add ability to link files to each other in terms of same directory, includes of each other, shared code, back of book terms
and general "proximity" which might be rleated over time in the logs.

Proposing file linking design

I need to develop a design proposal for linking files together based on shared relationships. I'll outline an implementation plan
that includes building a graph of files with categorized edges, making incremental indexing and event-driven updates. This involves
extracting dependencies and detecting shared code.

Additionally, I'll include a UI for inspection, storage locations, API endpoints for querying, and a configuration for language
patterns. While a detailed code skeleton could be helpful, it seems the focus is more on a clear, concise plan rather than immediate
code patches. Performance and privacy considerations will also be mentioned.

Structuring the response

I'm aiming to create a well-organized response that includes sections like Goals, Relationship Types, Data Model, and more. I’m
thinking of starting with simple heuristics, focusing on same directory edges, Python imports, co-modifications within a time window,
and shared logs during intervals.

I’ll include a CLI for rebuilding the index, specific API endpoints, and the edge schema. Additionally, I'll create rules to capture
terms and outline implementation steps for the next sprint to ensure everything is clear and concise.


codex
Great idea — think of this as building a live “code relationship graph” the monitor maintains and serves. Here’s a clear, incremental
plan that keeps it fast and useful.

Goals

- Build and serve a file graph with typed edges:
    - Same directory siblings
    - Import/include dependencies
    - Shared-code similarity
    - Glossary/back-of-book term links
    - Temporal proximity (co-activity in logs/events)
- Update incrementally from monitor events.
- Expose simple APIs/UI to explore neighbors and relevance.

Edge Types (start small, grow)

- dir_sibling: files under the same immediate directory.
- import_dep: file A imports/includes file B (language-aware patterns).
- shared_tokens: file A and B share significant code shingles (minhash/jaccard).
- term_ref: file/log mentions one of the tracked terms → link files sharing terms.
- co_activity: files co-modified or co-logged within a sliding time window (e.g., 5–15 mins).

Data Model

- Node: path, last_seen, size, lang (heuristic), tags (e.g., test, config).
- Edge: (src, dst, type, weight, ts, evidence).
- Store as append-only NDJSON + compact JSON indices:
    - .gnosis-flow/graph/nodes.json
    - .gnosis-flow/graph/edges.ndjson (append-only)
    - .gnosis-flow/graph/index.json (periodic rebuild for fast neighbor queries)

Extraction (incremental, event-driven)

- Same dir (baseline):
    - On file_event: add/update node; link to existing files in same dir with type dir_sibling (weight low).
- Imports/includes (initially Python/JS; pluggable later):
    - Python: parse import x / from x import y; map to files via module→path heuristics under watched roots.
    - JS/TS: import ... from / require().
    - Edge import_dep with moderate weight; store raw import text as evidence.
- Shared code (shingles/minhash):
    - For files < N KB, compute 5–7 token shingles and minhash sketch; compare to cache to add shared_tokens edges above threshold
(weight ∝ jaccard).
    - Compute lazily after modify events; cap to protect CPU.
- Terms (back-of-book):
    - Maintain a term list (from config or learned from logs).
    - When a file/log line contains a term, attach tag to node and add term_ref edges to other files with same term (weight decays
over time).
- Temporal proximity:
    - Maintain a rolling window of events; create co_activity edges for files seen within the window (weight decays; multiple
co-occurrences strengthen the edge).

Persistence & APIs

- Write edges as they are discovered; rebuild an adjacency index periodically or on demand.
- HTTP:
    - GET /graph/neighbors?path=<p>&limit=20 → [{neighbor, type, weight, evidence}]
    - GET /graph/node?path=<p> → node metadata + top edges
    - GET /graph/search?term=foo → files tagged with term + related
    - gnosis-flow graph neighbors "<path>"
    - gnosis-flow graph rebuild-index
    - gnosis-flow terms list/add/remove (optional)

UI (light)

- Add a Graph tab next to the console:
    - Path input → list neighbors grouped by type (DIR / IMPORT / SHARED / TERM / ACTIVITY) with weights.
    - Click neighbor to refocus.
    - Show recent evidence lines on hover (from event log or stored evidence).

Incremental Update Logic

- On file_event:
    - Update node metadata (size, ts), dir_sibling edges, schedule shingle computation (if size < cap).
- On log_line:
    - Record term hits; update term_ref edges; update co_activity window; write event to events.ndjson.
- On rule_hit/file_stats:
    - Adjust co_activity weights; use deltas to prioritize shared_tokens recompute if delta large.

Config

- .gnosis-flow/config.yaml (extend):
    - graph:
    - enable: true
    - shingle_size: 5
    - minhash_bands: 20
    - similarity_threshold: 0.35
    - coactivity_window_sec: 600
    - exclude_globs: […]
- terms:
    - tracked: ["database", "timeout", "payment", "auth", …]

Performance & Safety

- Cap minhash to small/medium files; sample windows for large files.
- Skip binary files (null-byte heuristic).
- Rate-limit updates; batch index rebuilds.
- Never block monitor loop; offload heavy work to background tasks.

Phased Delivery

1. Phase 1 (24–48h)

- Edges: dir_sibling, import_dep (Python only), co_activity (time window).
- Persistence: nodes.json + edges.ndjson + index.json (simple adjacency map).
- APIs: /graph/neighbors, /graph/node
- Console: add link to Graph panel with basic neighbor list.

2. Phase 2

- Shared_tokens via minhash (small files only); display weights and diff evidence snippet.
- Terms: configurable list, term_ref edges; simple /terms API.

3. Phase 3

- JS/TS import detection; richer UI (grouped neighbors, weights).
- Optional: server-side filtered event queries (type=…, path glob, term).

4. Phase 4
- Edge decay over time + periodic compaction.

If you want, I’ll start Phase 1 now: add the graph store, wire dir_sibling/import_dep/co_activity, add /graph/neighbors and a basic UI
panel to inspect neighbors for a file.

what dependencies areyou considering (do not start yet)

codex
Great question. For the graph features we discussed (no code yet), here are the dependencies I’m considering, grouped by priority and
with rationale.

Core (no new deps)

- Stdlib only:
    - ast/tokenize/pathlib/re/json/hashlib/time: Python import parsing, tokenization, file ops, JSON/NDJSON persistence, timestamps,
basic hashing.
    - fnmatch/glob: path filtering.
    - difflib: small diffs (we already use this).
- Existing deps already in gnosis-flow:
    - PyYAML: config/rules
    - rapidfuzz: fuzzy matches (already present)

Optional (quality/performance)

- datasketch (MinHash/LSH): efficient shared-code similarity across files.
    - Why: scalable shingles/minhash for “shared_tokens” edges; avoids O(n^2) comparisons.
    - Version: datasketch>=1.5.9
- orjson (fast JSON): faster read/write for events/graph indices (still fine with stdlib).
- blake3 (fast hashing): faster content hashing/minhash shingles (optional micro-optimization).
- networkx (graph tooling): would simplify neighbors/shortest-path queries; not strictly necessary if we keep a custom adjacency map.

Language support (import/include detection)

- Python: stdlib ast (recommended).
- JS/TS (later phase):
    - Start with lightweight regex on import/require lines to avoid heavy parsers.
    - Optional (future): esprima-python or tree-sitter (heavier, only if we need solid JS/TS parsing coverage).

Storage choices

- NDJSON + compact JSON indices (default):
    - No new deps; portable; append-only edges.ndjson and index.json for adjacency.
- Optional alternative (not required now):
    - SQLite (stdlib): if we want indexed queries and constraints later.

UI/HTTP

- No new frontend deps:
    - Keep the Graph panel simple (list neighbors, grouped by type).
    - SSE/HTTP endpoints are already in-process (no new server deps).

Testing

- pytest (already in your environment)
- No extra test deps needed beyond what we’ve been using.

Summary

- Minimal path: stick to stdlib + current deps; add datasketch if we want real minhash similarity (recommended for Phase 2).
- Avoid heavy parsers and graph libs initially; start with Python ast and regex for JS/TS, and our own adjacency indices.
- Keep storage as NDJSON/JSON for portability and simplicity; revisit SQLite only if needed.

If you want me to preflight lock versions (e.g., pin datasketch) or benchmark minhash vs. rapidfuzz token overlap on a sample, I can do
that before we start.

we want to expose in a way an MCP or AHP tool can query it, if that makes sense? what would we return? related files? what is the
query? think through first, don't code yet.

Designing API for Graph Exposure

I’m working on how to expose the file relationship graph using MCP or AHP tools. The user emphasized to think through the design first,
touching on thoughtful API design elements like query inputs, response schemas, tool endpoints, and parameters. I need to consider
aspects like events proximity and term matches, then propose functions like graph.neighbors and graph.search. For MCP, I'll suggest
JSON schemas for standardized responses. I'll also keep in mind rate-limits and avoid heavy operations.

Refining Query Parameters for Graph API

I'm outlining the necessary query parameters for our API, such as limits, type filters, time windows, and minimum weights. I'll suggest
functions like graph_neighbors and graph_related, with options for directionality and evidence inclusion. Use cases will help justify
the design. It’s essential to unify schemas for both MCP and AHP using JSON for request and response formats. I'll also detail scoring,
security measures to protect file content, and consider time complexity with precomputed indexing for efficient queries.

Including Real-time Update Tools

I’m looking at incorporating a tool for streaming updates via SSE or a subscription model. In MCP tools, updates are typically
synchronous, so I might return the last N edge events for a specific path. I should also consider parameters like "resolve" for files
or directories, along with options like "only_same_dir" and "include_nonexistent." Plus, I want to mention the ability to specify
"context" for line snippets that could help compute on-the-fly similarity with log lines across files. Let’s get this drafted!



codex
Great goal. Here’s a concrete, tool-friendly design that MCP or AHP can query consistently. No code yet; this is the proposed contract,
behavior, and performance envelope.

What the graph represents

- Nodes: project files (scoped to the watched roots). Metadata: path, last_seen, size, lang, tags (e.g., test/config), deleted? (if
tracked).
- Edges (typed, weighted):
    - dir_sibling: same immediate directory.
    - import_dep: A imports/includes B (directional).
    - shared_tokens: code similarity via shingles/minhash (small/medium files).
    - term_ref: files share glossary/back-of-book terms.
    - co_activity: files co-modified/mentioned within a time window.
- Evidence: minimal supporting info (e.g., import lines, term hits, minhash bands matched, event timestamps).

What we expose via tools (MCP/AHP)

- Primary read tools (sync, return JSON)
    - graph.neighbors
    - Purpose: Given a path (or paths), find related files, scored and grouped by edge types.
    - Args:
      - path: string (or paths: [string])
      - limit: int (default 20; max 100)
      - types: [dir_sibling|import_dep|shared_tokens|term_ref|co_activity] (optional filter)
      - direction: out|in|both (for import_dep; default both)
      - time_window_sec: int (for co_activity recency; default 3600)
      - min_weight: float (0–1) to prune weak edges (default 0.15)
      - include_evidence: bool (default false; true returns minimal evidence)
      - include_edges: bool (default false; true returns edge list for top nodes)
    - Returns:
      - query: echo of args
      - nodes: [
          {
            path: string,
            score: float (0–1),
            reasons: [ { type, weight, contribution, evidence? } ],
            groups: [ dir_sibling, import_dep_in|out, shared_tokens, term_ref, co_activity ],
            last_seen: ts?
          }, ...
        ]
      - paging: optional cursor if more than limit
    - Scoring:
      - Combine edge weights per type with configurable multipliers (e.g., import_dep 1.0, shared_tokens 0.8, dir_sibling 0.4, term_ref
0.3, co_activity 0.3) and normalize to 0–1. Clamp and rank by score.
- graph.explain_edge
    - Purpose: Explain why two files are related (edges and evidence).
    - Args: src_path, dst_path, types?, include_evidence?
    - Returns:
    - edges: [ { type, weight, ts?, evidence? } ], summary: string
- graph.search_terms
    - Purpose: Find files connected by a term or set of terms; optionally IR-style ranking.
    - Args: terms: [string], mode: any|all (default any), limit, include_evidence?
    - Returns: nodes (as above; reasons include term_ref), top_terms (if learning enabled)
- graph.coactivity
    - Purpose: Show files that move together across time windows, with recency bias.
    - Args: path, time_window_sec, limit
    - Returns: nodes with co_activity reasons (timestamps).
- graph.imports
    - Purpose: List import relationships for a file (in/out).
    - Args: path, direction: out|in|both, limit, include_evidence?
    - Returns: nodes with import_dep reasons.

Optional write/stream tools (later)

- graph.subscribe (SSE or server-side) not typically MCP, but could return a recent window of edge updates.
- graph.snapshot: save a JSON snapshot of neighbors/reasons (for debugging).
- graph.rebuild_index: admin tool to rebuild adjacency/index structures.

Complementary APIs (HTTP for convenience)
- GET /graph/neighbors?path=…&limit=…&types=…
- GET /graph/node?path=… (node meta + top edges)
- GET /graph/search?term=db&mode=any&limit=…
- GET /graph/imports?path=…&direction=in
- GET /graph/events?path=… (recent events to provide timing context)
- Paging and caching headers where useful.

Response design details

- Nodes
    - path: normalized project-relative path
    - score: overall numeric 0–1
    - reasons: structured list explaining the score contributions
    - { type: import_dep_in, weight: 0.6, contribution: 0.5, evidence: "from foo import bar" }
    - { type: shared_tokens, weight: 0.4, contribution: 0.3, evidence: { jaccard: 0.42, bands: 7 } }
    - { type: dir_sibling, weight: 0.2, contribution: 0.08 }
- groups: flattened tags for quick display
- last_seen: last file_event/log event timestamp
- Evidence limits
    - Trim evidence to small excerpts and anonymize where appropriate; don’t return file content beyond a few lines or import
statements.
    - Respect exclusions; never return paths outside the watch roots.

Query shape for MCP/AHP

- Simple JSON args per tool, JSON schema for args and returns (the AHP registry supports get_schema; we can publish these tools with
parameter schemas).
- Example MCP call:
    - gf_graph.neighbors { "path":"src/app.py", "limit":20, "types":["import_dep","shared_tokens"], "include_evidence":true }
- Example AHP tool call:
    - @tool(name="graph.neighbors", parameters={ "path": {"type":"str", "required":true}, "limit":{"type":"int","default":20}, … })

Performance considerations

- Indexing:
    - Maintain nodes.json + adjacency index.json updated incrementally; edges.ndjson append-only.
    - Rebuild adjacency lazily or on a timer to amortize.
- Co-activity window:
    - Maintain a small in-memory deque keyed by ts; spill to disk for persistence.
- Similarity:
    - Only compute minhash for files under size cap; schedule recompute for modified files; reuse existing sketches.

Scoring strategy (configurable)

- Default multipliers for edge types:
    - import_dep: 1.0
    - shared_tokens: 0.8
    - dir_sibling: 0.4
    - term_ref: 0.3
    - co_activity: 0.3
- Combine: weighted sum capped to 1.0; decay over time for co_activity and term_ref.

Security/Scope

- Only return project-scoped paths.
- Respect excludes and private directories (e.g., .gnosis-flow internals).
- Do not include full file content; only small import lines or term matches.

Developer UX

- Start with neighbors and explain_edge tools — most useful day-1.
- The query is always explicit (path, types, limit). Defaults should be safe and fast.
- Keep the response “explainable”: reasons and evidence are compact and usable by humans (and UIs).

If this design looks good, I’ll implement Phase 1 (neighbors + imports + co-activity, APIs + schemas + basic UI) with no new deps; then
we can add minhash (datasketch) and terms in Phase 2.
